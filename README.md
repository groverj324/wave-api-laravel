# Wave API Endpoints

This repo contains the API Endpoints for [Laravel Wave](https://wave.devdojo.com).

## How to Use

You'll need to download the free [Insomnia API REST Client](https://insomnia.rest). Once you have downloaded and installed you will need to import the `wav-api-endpoints.json` file from this repo.

To import the endpoints you can do this from the main screen where you can click on Import File.

After, importing the file, you can click to open up that project and click on the debug tab and you'll see all the endpoints for testing your wave application.

> Note, you may wish to change the `base_url` variable. By default it is set to http://wave.test, but you can click on that variable and change it to be the URL where you have installed the Wave App.
